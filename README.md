I solved three Greedy Algorithmic Problems
<br>
Coin Change Problem:
The coin change problem seeks to find the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount. Greedy algorithms, like the greedy coin change approach, prioritize the largest denomination coins, efficiently minimizing the number of coins required for the change.

Activity Selection Problem:
In the activity selection problem, a set of activities with start and finish times must be selected to maximize the number of non-overlapping activities. Greedy algorithms can efficiently solve this by sorting activities by their finish times and selecting those that don't overlap.
<br>
Fractional Knapsack Problem:
The fractional knapsack problem involves selecting items from a set with different weights and values to maximize the total value while fitting within a knapsack's weight constraint. Greedy algorithms sort items by value-to-weight ratio, taking fractions of items to optimize value.
